<center><p style="font-size:2vw; font-family:Courier New;" >Mario Alberto Kempes Chiodi ; born 15 July 1954 in Bell Ville, Cordoba) is a retired Argentine footballer who played as a striker. <br> His father, Mario, also a footballer, inspired him to play from a young age.<br> <br> At the age of seven he began playing with a junior team and at fourteen, he joined the Talleres reserves.<br> A prolific goalscorer, at club level he is best known for playing for Valencia, finishing as La Liga's top goalscorer twice, and amassing 116 goals in 184 league games for the club.<br><br>

At international level, Kempes was the focal point of Argentina's 1978 World Cup win where he scored twice in the final, and received the Golden Boot as top goalscorer.<br> He also won the Golden Ball for the player of the tournament, making him one of only three players to have won all three awards at a single World Cup, along with Garrincha in 1962, and Paolo Rossi in 1982.<br><br>

Kempes won South American Footballer of the Year, Onze d'Or European footballer of the Year, and World Cup Golden Ball in 1978.<br> In 2004, he was named as one of the Top 125 greatest living footballers as part of FIFA's 100th anniversary celebrationv </p><center>

<center><p style="font-size:2vw; font-family:Courier New;">Kempes was nicknamed El Toro and El Matador. <br>His career started at local club Instituto, where he played alongside Osvaldo Ardiles before quickly moving on to Rosario Central, where he scored 85 goals in 105 matches and established himself as a remarkable goalscorer, which prompted a move to Valencia CF<br>. At Mestalla he would go on to win the Copa del Rey, the European Cup Winners' Cup and the UEFA Super Cup as well as two consecutive Pichichis, scoring 24 and 28 goals in 1976-77 and 1977-78 seasons.<br> Famous as a hard-working forward, he used to strike from outside the penalty area with his surging runs towards goal and was not the traditional center-forward operating solely inside the box.<br> Many defenders found difficulty handling his attacking style.<br>

Before the 1978 World Cup, Kempes was the only foreign based player on the list of coach Cesar Luis Menotti's national team in Argentina, he was at the time playing for Spanish giants Valencia while the other squad members all played in Argentina.<br> The coach described him when announcing the squad he had selected for the 1978 tournament, "He's strong, he's got skill, he creates spaces and he shoots hard.<br> He's a player who can make a difference, and he can play in a centre-forward position."<br>

Kempes had been the top scorer in La Liga the previous two seasons and was determined to show on home soil that he could deliver against the best on the sport's greatest stage.<br> However, in 1974, at the age of 20, he failed to get on the score-sheet in West Germany and after the first round group stage in 1978, his name was still missing among goal scorers in the tournament.<br>

In 1978, he was named South American Football Player of the Year ("El Mundo," Caracas, Venezuela).<br> He was named by Pele as one of the top 125 greatest living footballers in March 2004.<br>
